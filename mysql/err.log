[WARNING]: Consider using the get_url or uri module rather than running 'curl'.
If you need to use command because get_url or uri is insufficient you can add
'warn: false' to this command task or set 'command_warnings=False' in
ansible.cfg to get rid of this message.
[WARNING]: Consider using the unarchive module rather than running 'unzip'.  If
you need to use command because unarchive is insufficient you can add 'warn:
false' to this command task or set 'command_warnings=False' in ansible.cfg to
get rid of this message.
[WARNING]: Consider using the service module rather than running 'service'.  If
you need to use command because service is insufficient you can add 'warn:
false' to this command task or set 'command_warnings=False' in ansible.cfg to
get rid of this message.
